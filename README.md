## Analyzing Venture Capital Funding through Deep Learning

This tool harnesses the power of neural networks to forecast the success potential of applicants seeking funds from the venture capital entity, Alphabet Soup.

The dataset employed here is a CSV file, comprising records of over 34,000 entities that previously secured funding from Alphabet Soup. This comprehensive csv file encapsulates diverse details about each enterprise, with a particular focus on its eventual success or failure. With this tool, a binary classification model is developed to anticipate if an applicant's venture will flourish in the future. The tool's specific features include:

* Data preprocessing tailored for neural network models.
* Implementation of the model-fit-predict paradigm to assemble and assess a binary classification model.
* Enhancement of model accuracy by conducting two supplementary analyses using varied inputs and evaluating the subsequent outcomes.
